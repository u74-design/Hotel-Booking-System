Then, Axios sends the response to the backend, i.e. to the server, with the data. 
Server stores the data in the session. Then, session sends the session ID, i.e. the cookie, to the frontend.
The browser stores the cookies. So, whenever the user requests for other pages, then the cookies are sent back to the server.
So, if the session ID and the cookies are matched, that means the user is logged in, and if they are not matched, the user is not logged in. 
So, that's why cookies are sent back to the server to check the user's ID, which was sent to the browser by the server when the user was logged. 
So, if the ID got matched, the user is logged in on the other page also



Yes! You are basically correct, and you explained it in the right sequence. Let me clarify and tidy it up a little so it’s crystal clear:
User fills the signup form
Inputs: full name, email, password.
You capture these values using onChange and store them in state variables.
User clicks “Sign Up” → handleSignup runs
Sends the collected data (name, email, password) to the backend API (/signup) using Axios.
withCredentials: true ensures the session cookie is sent back and forth so the server can recognize the user.
Backend stores the user in session
Session keeps track of who is logged in.
Backend sends back the session ID as a cookie (like connect.sid) to the browser.
Browser stores the cookie
Every subsequent request from the browser will include this cookie automatically (because withCredentials: true).
Server checks the session ID in this cookie to see if the user is still logged in.
Get current user
After signup (or on page refresh), you call /current-user to fetch the session data (user object) from the backend.
This ensures the frontend knows exactly who is logged in and keeps the user “logged in” across pages.
Store user in UserContext
setUser(userRes.data.user) stores the user details globally.
Now, any other component can access the current user without calling the backend again.
✅ So yes, you understood it correctly!
The cookie + session combination keeps the user logged in.
The current user API ensures the frontend knows who the user is.
UserContext makes it available everywhere in your React app.




useLocation returns an object with details about the current page
(URL path, query params, hash, navigation key) and also contains state, 
which stores the object passed during navigation
